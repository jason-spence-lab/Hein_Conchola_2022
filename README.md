Abstract: Several methods have been developed to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into lung lineages; however, recent studies have shown that iPSC-derivatives can de-differentiate into off-target lineages. Given that bud tip progenitors (BTPs) of the developing lung give rise to all epithelial cell types, we sought to develop an iPSC organoid model with a stable NKX2-1+ BTP-like cells. Building on past work, we optimized a directed differentiation paradigm to generate spheroids with robust NKX2-1 expression. Spheroids were expanded into organoids that possessed NKX2-1+ BTP-like cells, which increased in number and stable phenotype over time. Single cell RNA-seq analysis revealed a high degree of transcriptional similarity between induced BTPs (iBTPs) and in vivo BTPs. Using FACS, iBTPs can be purified and expanded as induced bud tip organoids (iBTO). When iBTOs are directed to differentiate into airway or alveolar cell types using well-established methods, they give rise into organoids composed of organized airway or alveolar epithelium, respectively. Collectively, iBTOs are comparable to in vivo BTPs and can maintain a stable phenotype in vitro, providing an important model to study human lung development and differentiation.
